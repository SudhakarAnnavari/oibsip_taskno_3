Task 3:- CALCULATOR To create a basic calculator using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, you'll need to implement an interactive interface with buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The calculator should have a display screen to show user input and results. Utilize CSS grid system for button alignments. Use event listeners, if-else statements, operators, and loops to handle user input and perform calculations. This project requires some skill but can be done with basic knowledge of these technologies..
