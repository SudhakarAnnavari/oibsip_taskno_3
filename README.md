Task 3:- The provided code is for a simple web-based temperature converter. It includes an HTML file with a form that allows users to input a temperature value and choose whether it's in Celsius or Fahrenheit. The JavaScript code handles the conversion based on user input and displays the converted temperature on the webpage. The converter dynamically updates the result based on whether the user wants to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit or vice versa. The application utilizes Bootstrap for styling and some JavaScript functions for temperature conversion.
